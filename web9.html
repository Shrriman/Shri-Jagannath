        <h3>"Om Nilachala Nivasaya Nityaya Paramatmane,<br>
          Balabhadra Subhadrabhyam Jagannathaya Te Namah."
        </h3>

<p> Shri Jagannath, the Lord of the Universe, is considered an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is worshipped in the form of Lord Krishna. With his large round eyes, a red mouth, black-colored divine face, and semi-formed arms, his appearance is quite distinctive. For this reason, some people call him ‚ÄúAdha Gadha Dian‚Äù (half-formed deity). His main temple is located in the south east direction of the city of Puri in Odisha. There, he is worshipped seated on the Ratna Singhasana (gem-studded throne) along with his elder brother Balabhadra, sister Subhadra, and the divine discus Sudarshan. Hence, Puri is counted among the four sacred dhams (holy pilgrimage sites) of India.<br><br>

It is believed that Lord Vishnu, along with Goddess Mahalaxmi, visits the four holy shrines every day. Every morning, He takes a holy bath first at Badrinath. Then, at noon, He comes to Puri to partake in the Mahaprasad. In the evening, He rests at Rameshwaram and at night, He retires to sleep at Haridwar. It is said that this routine has been followed since time immemorial.<br><br>

Lord Vishnu has incarnated in various forms in every Yuga (age) to protect His devotees. These four places signify His abodes in the four Yugas. In Satya Yuga, He resided as Badrinath in Uttarakhand; in Treta Yuga, as Ramnath in Rameshwaram; in Dwapara Yuga, as Dwarkanath in Dwarka. Now, in this Kali Yuga, to grant salvation to His devotees, He is worshipped as Shri Jagannath in Shri Kshetra Puri.<br><br>
    
Shri Jagannath is a symbol of pride for every Odia. His glory is world-renowned. Let us now understand the significance of his divine form.</p>

   There is a story behind the unique form of Lord Jagannath. It dates back to the Dwapara Yuga. One day, while Lord Krishna was resting, his two wives ‚Äî Devi Rukmini and Devi Satyabhama ‚Äî were sitting beside him. They wanted to know whose name the Lord would take first upon waking. They hoped he would call one of them first. However, as soon as Lord Krishna woke up, he first uttered the name of Radha.<br><br>

Now, Rukmini and Satyabhama had never heard the complete story of Radha and Krishna's eternal love. So, they went to Mother Rohini and requested her to narrate the story of Radha-Krishna's Rasaleela (divine dance of love). Mother Rohini feared that if Krishna and Balaram heard these past tales, they might be drawn back to Vrindavan again. So, she asked Devi Subhadra to stand guard at the door while she narrated the story. Rohini Devi then began describing the divine and priceless love story of Radha and Krishna.<br><br>

After a while, both Krishna and Balaram arrived at the spot. Subhadra, being so engrossed in the story, didn't notice their arrival. The tale was so sweet and mesmerizing that all three ‚Äî Krishna, Balaram, and Subhadra ‚Äî became deeply emotional and overwhelmed with divine love.<br><br>

At that moment, the great sage Devarshi Narada happened to pass by. Seeing the Lord and his siblings in such a divine state, he too was drawn toward them and came to witness their divine expressions. As Narada approached, Mother Rohini's eyes fell on the divine trio. Everyone present was deeply moved and enchanted by this extraordinary divine form. Sage Narada then requested the Lord that this divine form should be made visible to the entire world. In response, Lord Krishna declared that in the age of Kali Yuga, the three of them ‚Äî Krishna, Balaram, and Subhadra ‚Äî would be worshipped in this very divine form by the people of the world.<br><br>

So, calling Shri Jagannath ‚Äúhalf-formed deity‚Äù is incorrect. His hand is not incomplete, it is unlimited, which has no limits. He has spread his arms to infinite distance to embrace everyone. He is complete within the incomplete, formless within the form. He has neither any beginning nor any end. This incompleteness of his gives him perfection. He is a divine symbol of unconditional love and supreme devotion Lord of the universe Shri Jagannath.</p></div>

The main temple of Shri Jagannath located in Puri is known as "Shri Mandir" (Bada Deula). This temple is built on the Nilagiri mountain by the sea shore, and hence this place is also called Nilachal. According to ancient scriptures and Puranas, it is believed that there once stood a high mountain called Nilagiri. However, that mountain no longer exists. Due to the cycle of time (Kalachakra) and natural changes, it has vanished. The height of this temple is 65 meters (214 feet). It is constructed on approximately 400,000 square feet (37,000 square meters) of land in Puri. It is considered one of the tallest temples in India.<br><br>

At the top of this temple, there is a huge wheel called the Neelachakra (Blue Wheel). The flag flying above the Neelachakra is called the Patitpavan flag. It is believed that simply by seeing this Neelachakra and the Patitpavan flag, all sorrows are removed. There are four main gates around the Shri Mandir for entry. The eastern gate is called Singha Dwara (The Lion‚Äôs Gate), the western gate is Vyaghra Dwara (The Tiger‚Äôs Gate), the northern gate is Hasti Dwara (The Elephant‚Äôs Gate), and the southern gate is Ashwa Dwara (The Horse‚Äôs Gate).<br><br>

To protect the Shri Mandir from enemy attacks, a wall (called a Pacheri) surrounds the temple complex on all sides. This wall is known as the Meghnad Pacheri. The Meghnad Pacheri is the outer wall of the Shri Mandir, and its height is approximately 20 feet (6 meters).<br><br>

In front of Singha Dwara stands a gigantic pillar on which sits Arun, the elder brother of Garuda, the king of birds. Hence, it is called the Arun Stambh (Arun Pillar). Its height is about 11 meters (36 feet). This pillar was originally located at the Konark Sun Temple. The Maratha rulers brought it from there and installed it in front of the Shri Mandir.<br><br>

Above Singha Dwara, as the gatekeeper, is the goddess Mahalaxmi, the wife of Shri Jagannath, who is also called Maa Annapurna. On both sides of her, her attendants are also seen. Another name of Lakshmi Ji is Shri. Wherever Maa Lakshmi resides, that place is filled with happiness and prosperity. Therefore, this temple is named Shri Mandir and the place is called Shri Kshetra in her honor.<br><br>

Earlier, the figures of Dashavatara adorned the top of Singha Dwara, but due to differing opinions about Shri Vishnu‚Äôs ninth avatar, these statues were removed. Some great scriptures like Srimad Bhagavat Purana consider Lord Buddha as Shri Vishnu‚Äôs ninth avatar, while some believe Shri Jagannath to be Shri Vishnu‚Äôs ninth avatar. There is no conclusive evidence on this matter yet.<br><br>

Only followers of Sanatan Dharma are allowed to enter the Shri Mandir. Many poor, untouchables, and people of other religions are not permitted entry. For them, the image of Mahaprabhu called Shri Patitpavan is worshiped on the left side of Singh Dwar.<br><br>

After crossing Singh Dwar, one must ascend Baisi Pahacha (twenty-two stairs). These stairs represent a mantra composed of twenty-two letters. The mantra is:- 
<center><b>"Shri Krishna Govind Hare Murari,<br>
He Nath Narayan Vasudeva."<br></b></center>

<div class = "p">
On the third step of the Baisi Pahacha, Dharmaraj Yama stands upon a sacred stone known as Yamashila It is believed that placing one‚Äôs foot on this stone while entering the temple washes away all sins, but stepping on it while leaving the temple makes one share in all sins.<br><br>

To the left of the Baisi Pahach is the Snana Mandapa (the bathing pavilion) of the deities and Anand Bazaar, and on the south side is the Chahani Mandapa (the viewing pavilions of Shri Jagannath and Maa Mahalaxmi) and the temple‚Äôs kitchen. This kitchen is the largest in India. Every day, sixty varieties of pouthis and fifty-six varieties of bhogs (offerings) are prepared for Mahaprabhu. These offerings are called Mahaprasad. Near the Snana Mandapa, there is a secretly located Suna Kua (golden well). During the Snana Yatra, the sacred water from this well is used to bathe the deities.<br><br>

Beyond the Baisi Pahach lies the Kurma Pacheri (Tortoise Wall), which is called the Antah Pacheri (inner enclosure) of the Shri Mandir. Its height is about 8 meters (26 feet). The area between the Kurma Pacheri and Meghnad Pacheri is known as the Bahara Bedha (outer enclosure). Within this enclosure, to the left side of the Hasti Dwara (Elephant Gate), is located Koili Vaikuntha. During the Nabakalebara festival, the old wooden idols of the deities are buried here. It is said that Lord Jagannath appeared here to Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Cuckoo. Hence, it is named Koili Vaikuntha.<br><br>

The space situated between the Kurma Pacheri (Tortoise Wall) and the Bada Deula (main temple) is known as the Bhitara Bedha (inner enclosure). In this enclosure, on the southern side of the Shri Mandir, lie the Kalpa Vriksha (Divine Wish-Fulfilling Tree), Mukti Mandap (Liberation Platform), and Rohini Kunda (sacred pond). It is believed that the Kalpa Vriksha has been present here since the Satya Yuga (the first of the four ages). According to legend, during the Mahapralaya (great deluge), sage Markandeya took shelter at the roots of this tree and survived. It is also believed that Rohini Kunda is connected to the Paatala Loka (the netherworld), which is why its water is never seen flowing out. During Nabakalebara, the water from this Kunda flows out, and with this water, the old Darubigrahas (wooden idols) of the deities are ritually bathed.<br><br>

To have the darshan (sacred view) of the Chaturdha Murtis (the four deities), one must pass through three mandapas (halls).<br>

<b>1. Bhoga Mandapa:</b> This is the place where the bhoga (offerings) brought from the temple kitchen (Rosha Sala) are first presented to the Chaturdha Murtis. After this, the same offering is taken to Maa Bimala and offered to her, after which it is declared as Mahaprasad, the holy food.<br>

<b>2. Nata Mandapa:</b> This hall resembles a stage within the temple complex. On special days and during festivals, various dance, music, and cultural performances are organized here in devotion to the deities.<br>

<b>3. Jagamohana:</b> This is the main hall of the temple, also known as the Darshan Mandapa. Here, devotees gather and stand to have darshan of the Chaturdha Murtis ‚Äî Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, Maa Subhadra, and Lord Sudarshan.<br><br>

The most sacred part of the Shri Jagannath Temple is the Bada Deula. The inner sanctum of this Bada Deula is called the Garbha Gruha (sanctum sanctorum). This is the holiest and most secret part of the temple, where Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Sudarshan reside on the Ratna Singhasana (Gem-studded throne) in their Darubrahma (sacred wooden) forms.<br><br>

To the left side of the  Garbha Gruha (sanctum sanctorum), there is a hidden room where the divine jewels and ornaments of the Chaturdha Murtis (the four deities) are kept. This room is known as the Ratna Bhandara (Treasure Store). It is believed that, The Nagas (serpents) guard the Ratna Bhandar under the command of Goddess Vimala. Ordinary devotees are not allowed to enter the Garbha Gruha. Only authorized team of the temple's managing committee are permitted to enter this highly sacred and restricted area.<br><br>

<P>Puri is not only famous for Shri Mandir, there are many other places of interest in Puri apart from this temple. There is another temple 3 km away from Shri Mandir. Its name is Shri Gundicha Temple.This Gundicha Temple is said to be birthplace of Lord Jagannath. The 3 km long road from the temple to the Gundicha Temple is called Badadanda (Grand Road).<br><br>

Between the Shri Mandir and the Gundicha Temple, there is another temple called Maushi Maa Mandir (Ardhashosini Mandir). The sea had tried to submerge the Shri Mandir many times. Once, when the sea was rushing towards the Shri Mandir, Aunt Ardhashosini absorbed half of its water. From that day on, her name was Ardhashosini and she was known as the Maushi Maa (Aunt) of Mahaprabhu. It is said that when Shri Jagannath and Shri Balabhadra were wandering here and there hungry for 12 years after being cursed by Lakshmi, Devi Subhadra took shelter of Aunt Ardhashosini.<br><br>
